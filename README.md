# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
It is a Password Generator, at the click of the button, A Popup prompt box will ask "How many characters would you like your Password to contain?", input validations are included such as "Should be at least 8 characters and not more than 128", or if the user did not put anything, or if the user did put something aside from number. After the Password length is given, it will ask a series of Popup confirm boxes, whether the user wants the password to include lower/upper cases, numeric and/or special characters. User should at least pick one in order to generate a random one. The result will appear at the text area, in a jumbled form.

- Many conditional statements firing then looping, to test what I learned from Week 2 (15 MAR - 19 MAR) 
- To help ease of thinking complex passwords by just the click of a button (And a series of pop up boxes)
- Learned array looping, getting values from different popup boxes (confirm, alert and prompt), using Boolean values to trigger functions and to turn them off, input validations checks(series of if else if conditional statements)

### Screenshots
